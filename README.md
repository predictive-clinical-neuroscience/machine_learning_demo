# Machine Learning Demo

This repository contains scripts for the machine learning component of the 2024 summer school coordinated as part of the kick-off meeting for the [Earth Brain Health](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-024-00314-1) commision coordinated by the [environMENTAL](https://www.environmental-project.org/) project. 

This script demonstrates some basic machine learning models on a demo dataset. The execution is quite straightforward and can even be done within your browser, buy clicking the button below to start a session in Google Colab.
